#WDI - Asset collection

####Has this ever happened to you?:

You are prepping for a lesson in a current cohort, and trying to reference images in a markdown that you wrote for WDI's past... but... oh no! The images you are trying to reference are located in that past WDI's PRIVATE REPO and they are showing up like this...

![](/Users/keyan/Desktop/I_love_puppies_and_candy_and_dentist_visits.jpeeg)

or this...

####Well no more!

This is a PUBLIC repo for images and other assets that we can use across different cohorts. 

How to use:

1. Add an image here.
2. Link it in your markdowns.
3. Reuse your markdowns in the future and be pleasantly surprised that the images still appear.
